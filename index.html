           <p style=" margin-top: -5px; padding: 3px;">I was waiting for this album since... I don't even remember when it was told the release date, but I couldn't wait for it! 
<br><em>Never really over</em> — I loved this song from the first time I heard it (who didn't?), and when it was released I spent do much time searching on the Internet if Katy Perry announced a new album. Now, more than a year after, there we are :") .
<br><em>Cry about it later</em> — just because of the title I wanted to listen to this song so badly. I have to say I thoughtit would havebeen different: slower, more romantic, maybe. It has been absolutely amazing!!! At the beginning I was just stunned, but then—. The rhythm is so fast and upbeat, I loved it from the second chorus. If the whole album is like this I'm going to die. 
<br><em>Teary eyes</em> — the lyrics is very alike to the <em>Cry about it later</em> one, but I liked the other best. I thought this was a slow and gloomy, but no! This album surprises me. Anyway, I loved the "echoes¿" in the chorus and how Katy Perry says (in the last line of the chorus) "teary eyes". The whole song is so weird, so dreamy, it makes me think about being in a tunnel with colourful lights everywhere. While I listen to it I feel like I'm surrounded by so many colourful lights. I like it. 
<br><em>Daisies</em> — this song is perfect, I'm not changing my mind. The lyrics, how Katy Perry sings it, the lyrics, the music,THE LYRICS!!! It's a masterpiece. There are some (wonderful) days when I can't stop singing it...
<br><em>Resilient </em>— the lyrics!!! I loved the metaphor with the flower and even more the "hard-times-now-passed"/"to-be-at-your-best-you-have-to-have-passed-the-hard-times" ones. They were so original and poetic and inspiring. About the music... I guess I liked it, it's so bare. By the way, at the end I just thought "WHAT- ALREADY?!?!" 
<br><em>Not the end of the world</em> — okay, it's my favourite, really, it made me shiver. It's so completely hopeful, positive. The rhythm is gorgeous and the song to (Katy Perry sings it wonderfully). Every time I hear <br>
"It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world"<br>
I think I could die. <br>
Moreover, even my brother liked it, and he hates every song I make him listen to (he likes only rap/trap music :") ).
<br><em>Smile </em>— I loved this one from the very beginning. I love how it makes me feel happy, how it tells (in such a light way) how to pass an hard moment.<br> Also, my brother liked it :))) .
<br><em>Champagne problems</em> — the song is fine, but, in my opinion, too repetitive. I don't mind it though. "I don't mind it" is all I can think about this song: it didn't move me, nor made me feel in a certain way, but, so far, I wouldn't skip it. 
<br><em>Tucked</em> — I really liked this song! The music is really fast and light, frivolous maybe. By the third chorus I couldn't help but sing it and smile. I know the lyrics is less "important" than the others', but it's really, really nice.  
<br><em>Harleys in Hawaii</em> — the first times I listened to this song I didn't like it. I guess I haven't liked it for so long, but a few days ago I discovered I don't mind it. To be honest, I would have liked this song, hadn't it been for the lines <br>
"When I hula-hula, hula<br>
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler"<br>.
They don't make sense!!! They're stupid and inappropriate. Why did they write them?!?! I still think these things about those lines, but I stopped judging the song only for them. I like the relaxed and slow rhythm, even though the lyrics is not Katy Perry's best. 
<br><em>Only love</em> — I was ready to listen to a boring, silly and mundane love song but, another time, I was surprised. The chorus is so marvellous, with "draggings" of music and echoes... It's such a new song, speaking about regrets in such an odd and curious way.
<br><em>What makes a woman </em>— before the album was released I was so impatient and when this single came out... it was satisfying! I listened first to the acoustic version and, even if the lyrics and how Katy Perry sang it were amazing, I though it needed  <em>something</em> more. And when I found out there was also a non-acoustic version (and I listened to it) I liked it way best. The music is that <em>something</em> which makes the song perfect. (Anyway now I think the acoustic version has its nice parts and it's not bad.) 
<br>It's too bad in the original version of the album there aren't neither <em>Small Talk</em> nor <em>Never Worn White</em>. <em>Small Talk</em> is just perfect, so light and fast, <em>Never Worn White</em> is good, at the beginning I didn't like it (I found it too slow), but paying attention to the lyrics made me like it. <br>
My favourite songs are <em>Daisies</em>, <em>Not the end of the world</em> (!!!) and <em>Cry about it later</em>, but <em>Teary eyes</em>, <em>Tucked</em>, <em>Smile</em>, <em>Never really over</em> and <em>What makes a woman</em> also.<br>
To be honest, the whole album is so good and I can't decide which songs I prefer. I can't understand why all the critics I read don't appreciate it (and why it has so few visualisations on YouTube). It makes me feel sad.<br>
Even because I think this may be my favourite album by Katy Perry, I need to listen to it again.</p>

       <div class="rubrica" style=" font-size: 18px; width: 68%;">
            <h4>28th July 2020. <a style=" font-size: 0.75em;" href="https://just-a-booklover.github.io/just-a-bookworm.github.io-columns-july2020/">see more</a></h4>
           <p style=" margin-top: -5px; padding: 3px;">The 24th of July I was checking my Instagram profile from the browser (I deleted the app months ago), I don’t even know why I was on Instagram, I hardly ever check it, but I accidentally ended up in the Taylor Swift’s profile and... I couldn’t breathe, it was too good to be true, I couldn’t resist, I <strong>had to</strong> listen to her new album! Somehow I managed to wait until I could write down my reactions, and here they are ;) .<br>
<em>the 1</em> – I still haven’t figured out whether I liked that song or I didn’t, but I think that if I listen to it again I will like it. It’s so soft and it’s like a lullaby (and I love this kind of songs), but it’s gloomy and so different from the other Taylor Swift’s songs...<br>
<em>cardigan</em> – I was really eager to listen to this track and I absolutely liked it! I saw the official video, and if you haven’t still watched it, go and do it now! The video is really odd, but so is the song (can we talk about the cardigan metaphor?!?!). The lyrics and its meaning resemble that of Taylor Swift’s firsts albums (from <em>Taylor Swift</em> to <em>Speak Now</em>), but with a different music, softer (and I like it so much). I would say that is a really sweet song, very romantic; so far, the album makes me think about rainy days. <br>
<em>the last great american dynasty</em> – until when was told¿ Bill’s death, I didn’t understand what Taylor Swift wanted to pass down. Then I discovered it and… wow! It has something from <em>You need to calm down</em> or maybe from the most critic songs in <em>Reputation</em> but with the slow and quiet music which is characteristic of this album. I loved it from the very beginning.<br>
<em>exile</em> – I have so many things to say about this song. At the beginning I didn’t like it at all. I don’t know why, but I don’t like how male voices sound in a music context, and Bon Iver one is so low... When Taylor Swift started to sing, I began to like the song much more, but at the end it wasn’t bad: when the two of them were singing together their voices were... odd but in a good way, I guess. About the lyrics… I liked how every singer “played” a character and sang from its point of view.<br>
<em>my tears ricochet</em> – when I started it I didn’t like it very much, but at the end I wasn’t so sure, it’s a weird song. Now I’m listening to it again, and it’s not bad, but it’s so odd that I can’t decide. Maybe in a couple of days I will love it. Or maybe in a couple of hours, I just can’t stop thinking about it.<br> As I had foreseen, I love this song, I think it's one of my favourites. It takes me to other places, it makes me feel away from the world. And can we just talk about Taylor Swift's voice? It's wonderful, it makes the song magic.<br>
<em>mirrorball</em> – okay, I loved this song. It makes me feel quiet and it has something sweet and nice... I think it’s my favourite song of the album so far. Really,  I can’t find any flaws in the song, it’s just perfect! These verses<br>
<span id=”psmall”>“Hush, when no one is around, my dear<br>
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes<br>
Spinning in my highest heels, love”<br></span>
make me want to shut up and listen to the song, it’s wonderful.<br>
<em>seven</em> – another weird song. It started quickly and gave me a feeling of wildness (but in a good way, meaning like “freedom” or “untameableness”), it reminds me of a run in a wood (and, again, I don’t make sense). I am not sure whether I liked it or not, but it catches me with its fast rhythm.<br> I listened to it another time and I like it, I can’t stop thinking about it. I also thought about the lyrics and it’s really amazing. <br>
<em>august</em> – wow. I liked it so much, the refrain is so fast but at the same time it’s so plain. It has an almost lazy music, but the refrain makes it speed up. I haven’t listened to <em>betty</em> yet, but I read this song is part (according to the theories of Taylor Swift’s fan) of what the singer called “Teenage Love Triangle” with <em>cardigan</em> and of course <em>betty</em>. I also read that this songi s sang from Inez’s point of view, <em>cardigan</em> Betty’s and <em>betty</em> from James’ (Betty’s boyfriend?, I read that there are no pronouns which identify James as a boy, who cheats on her with Inez). I hope I’ll understand the triangle better with the 14th track (even if it’s clear that the songi s about a secret¿ love story).<br>
<em>this is me trying</em> – the stanzas of this song remind me of the bitterness in  <em>Reputation</em> but with no slyness. But I didn’t like it. It bored me, the lyrics didn’t convince me and the music is too plain. I have to admit Taylor Swift really opened up a lot in the song.<br>
<em>illicit affairs</em> – I thought about the song as I didn’t like it, (it bored me like <em>this is me trying</em>), but it’s not bad. I don’t completely like it, but it’s somehow magnetic.<br>
<em>invisible strings</em> - the song has so many references!!! From the first stanza there were references to <em>Red</em> (the song, not the album), but also to <em>Bad Blood</em> and  <em>Daylight</em>. It’s really lovely, the stanzas have something that reminds me of <em>I forgot that you existed</em>, but the refrain... it’s so amazing! Every time Taylor Swift starts singing "Time..." I feel like I’m overwhelmed. I need to listen to the song again!<br>

<em>mad woman</em> - I didn’t really like it. It’s very particular, it makes me sing along with the lyrics, but... it’s a weird song, I don’t like it.<br>

<em>epiphany</em> - I loved it so much. I love this kind of slow and bare songs! From the beginning it gave me a feeling off something broken, something dystopian, because of the music and the lyrics about chaos, war and violence.<br>

<em>betty</em> - I wanted to listen to this song so badly, to understand better the "Teenage Love Triangle" and I did. Everything in the song corresponds with Inez’s perspective from <em>august</em> and there are also so many references to <em>cardigan</em>! The last part, when James talks about Betty’s cardigan, but the lines <br>
<span id=”psmall”>"I'm only seventeen,<br>
I don't know anything"</span><br>
fit with <em>cardigan</em>’s<br>
<span id=”span”>"When you are young they assume you know nothing".</span>
There are other references, of course, (the clearest one is "Chase two girls lose the one") and this thing thrilled me. I liked the song itself, it feels like one of Taylor Swift’s first albums and the last lines (when James goes to Betty’s party) made me think about <em>Enchanted</em>. I was curious about this song, but I didn’t expect to love it as much as I do! <br>
<em>peace</em> - I feel different emotions about this song: I like the lyrics and how it’s sung, it’s pretty, but I thing that it doesn’t go along well with the music. The lyrics is like a step ahead of the music (which is good on its own, I love dream pop). Together, music and lyrics, in my opinion, they clash. <br>

<em>hoax</em> - the beginning of this song is like dystopian, too. I felt intrigued from the song at the very beginning. It’s a weird song, but I think I liked it, it’s very slow and it’s the perfect ending for the album. Was I the only one to catch some references to <em>The Archer</em>? The part about not watching the film because the hero was dead and those lines:<br>
<span id=”psmall”>"You knew it still hurts underneath my scars<br>
From when they pulled me apart".</span><br>

I liked the album a lot (especially <em>mirrorball</em>, <em>the last great american dynasty</em> and <em>betty</em>!!!), but, so far, I like better <em>Lover</em> (and definitely <em>Reputation</em>). I wrote “so far” because I am quite sure that I will listen again to the songs and I will change my opinions. Anyway <em>folklore</em> is a very odd album, and it shows that Taylor Swift grew up (or, at least, changed) from <em>Lover</em>.<br><br>
I posted this review a few days ago, but now I don't think it's worse than the last 2 Taylor Swift's albums. It's a great album, but different from the others, maybe it's more mature. My favourite song from <em>folklore</em> is <em>seven</em>. It's amazing, why didn't I like at the beginning???

           <p style=" margin-top: -5px; padding: 3px;">Saturday, the 27th June, was the Global Pride Day and, if it weren't for the pandemic, I would have joined the Milan pride parade. hen the parade was cancelled I felt a little bad, but what could they do?
        I've never been to a pride on purpose (last year I was on a studying holiday in Dublin and when we went in Belfast for a trip we saw the pride - even if nobody knew there would have been it). By the way, I didn't really join the parade, I just saw it, but there I decided I would have joined the Milan pride in 2020.
      I was excited to see the Virtual Global Pride, but I didn't like it: I saw just about an hour of the pride, but it seemed to be badly organized to me, too divided. Every person who made a speech spoke for about a minute and then appeared another person who told other different things. And the songs: they were put almost casually in the video... I don't know, in the official website it was described and i expected something way better. Now I hope I'll be at the Milan pride next year :) .</p>

            <p style=" margin-top: -5px; padding: 3px;">I know it could be commonplace, but I would like to talk about the <strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong> and about my experience¿ with these movies. I started to watch them about a year ago and unwillingly: I don't like this kind of movies at all and I was annoyed because 2 of my friends were always trying to make me watch the Avengers series. But I can't say no, so I have been forced to watch them. <strong>ONE OF THE BEST CHOICES I'VE EVER HAD!!!</strong> I know I'm dramatic, but it's true. I loved the movies (I mean- all but "Black Panther") and I also rewatched all of them.  I swear, I wouldn't have watched all the movies another time if it weren't for my brother. I mean- they're like 53? hours. Suicide. My brother decided to get into MCU when I watched "Avengers: Endgame". First, he saw it, then he started with "Iron Man". That's weird. Luckily, we finished the Avengers series quite quickly because of the quarantine. Despite everything, I've never watched a Marvel movie at the cinema -_- . I was really excited for the Black Widow's movie but eventually was delayed. I know they couldn't do otherwise, but I felt sad. Like a good reader, I would like to read the comics which inspired the productors. In February, I have been at a comicon and I wanted to buy a comic, but I couldn't decide which comic to buy and... I bought nothing. Next February I won't lose the chance. I also want to watch the X-Men series, but I would watch it with my brother, and he doesn't want to. By the way I'm still trying to convince him...</p>
