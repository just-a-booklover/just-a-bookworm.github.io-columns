        <p>In this column I'd like to post (when I have an idea for a topic) something about that topic. To be honest I don't know when I will have ideas, so I don't know when I will update this webpage.<br>
Of course you can suggest me some topics on <a href="https://tellonym.me/ranalettrice">tellonym</a>, everything you'd like to read my opinion on, "serious" or "not serious" things.</p>

           <p style=" margin-top: -5px; padding: 3px;">Saturday, the 27th June, was the Global Pride Day and, if it weren't for the pandemic, I would have joined the Milan pride parade. hen the parade was cancelled I felt a little bad, but what could they do?
        I've never been to a pride on purpose (last year I was on a studying holiday in Dublin and when we went in Belfast for a trip we saw the pride - even if nobody knew there would have been it). By the way, I didn't really join the parade, I just saw it, but there I decided I would have joined the Milan pride in 2020.
      I was excited to see the Virtual Global Pride, but I didn't like it: I saw just about an hour of the pride, but it seemed to be badly organized to me, too divided. Every person who made a speech spoke for about a minute and then appeared another person who told other different things. And the songs: they were put almost casually in the video... I don't know, in the official website it was described and i expected something way better. Now I hope I'll be at the Milan pride next year :) .</p>

            <p style=" margin-top: -5px; padding: 3px;">I know it could be commonplace, but I would like to talk about the <strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong> and about my experienceÂ¿ with these movies. I started to watch them about a year ago and unwillingly: I don't like this kind of movies at all and I was annoyed because 2 of my friends were always trying to make me watch the Avengers series. But I can't say no, so I have been forced to watch them. <strong>ONE OF THE BEST CHOICES I'VE EVER HAD!!!</strong> I know I'm dramatic, but it's true. I loved the movies (I mean- all but "Black Panther") and I also rewatched all of them.  I swear, I wouldn't have watched all the movies another time if it weren't for my brother. I mean- they're like 53? hours. Suicide. My brother decided to get into MCU when I watched "Avengers: Endgame". First, he saw it, then he started with "Iron Man". That's weird. Luckily, we finished the Avengers series quite quickly because of the quarantine. Despite everything, I've never watched a Marvel movie at the cinema -_- . I was really excited for the Black Widow's movie but eventually was delayed. I know they couldn't do otherwise, but I felt sad. Like a good reader, I would like to read the comics which inspired the productors. In February, I have been at a comicon and I wanted to buy a comic, but I couldn't decide which comic to buy and... I bought nothing. Next February I won't lose the chance. I also want to watch the X-Men series, but I would watch it with my brother, and he doesn't want to. By the way I'm still trying to convince him...</p>
